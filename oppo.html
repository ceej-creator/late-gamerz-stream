    <td>As our live stream progresses, we encounter technical issues such as disconnections on the live stream itself. Facebook also has a lot of disconnection on launching the live stream making it difficult for us to achieve a smooth pacing. Based on the viewer’s feedback we might need to have further optimizations on our live and smooth internet connection so this will be a crucial part for our area of improvement.</td>

    <td>We received feedback from viewers that our content should be enhanced in aspects such as having more than one game, more challenges to apply, volume enhancement so that it is heard and the pacing of the live should be smooth sailed following a much proper agenda and those are the things we need to work on for enhancing and presenting a better content for the viewers.</td>

    <td>Based on the feedback, some of the viewers experienced a poor performance when it comes to our camera and the camera seems to be not fixed. This will be in our area of improvement by fixing the quality and the perfect position of the camera since this is crucial for our live streaming.</td>

    <td>Some of the viewers suggested that we might need to improve such things as, they can see all of us, not just 1 or 2 people, Improving the gaming vibe of the players, more involvement, and extended time frame. By this, we will further improve our way of fulfilling the viewer’s request bringing a much lively and adaptable livestream and considering the obstacles preventing it.</td>
