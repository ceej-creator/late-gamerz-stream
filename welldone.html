    <td>The design of our stream is one of the heroes in MLBB (the game we stream), and it fits the theme. In that way, more viewers are entertained as all the aspects of content are connected. It is considered a job well done that contributed to the success of our livestream.</td>

    <td>Facebook really did well in our streaming platform especially when finding a specific type of livestream like gaming, friendly features and it is also free to use. By this, we also got the advantage of having more viewers since people these days are more into using Facebook.
</td>

    <td>MLBB is a popular game here in Southeast Asia and itâ€™s engaging due to the graphics and gameplay. These days, it is one of the top games played in the Philippines and most of our viewers are MLBB enthusiasts so in that way, we also got the chance to have connection and interaction with them too.</td>

    <td>We engaged with our viewers and talked to them while we were playing making it less boring and more fun. We are pretty sure they enjoyed it based on their comments and reactions on our live chat feed. We considered this well done as we executed all the ways needed for us to have a fun and interactive live experience with our viewers.</td>
