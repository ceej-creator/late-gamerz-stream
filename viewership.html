        <h3>VIEWERSHIP</h3>

        <br>

        <p>Our first stream had 292 total views, which shows that we had an extremely<br>
         high audience rate right from the start. Even after facing technical difficulties <br>
         that forced us to restart the stream, our second stream still pulled in an impressive <br> 
         207 views, and our third reached 166 views, proving that our audience remained highly engaged. <br>
<br>

In terms of engagement, our first stream had 2 shares, while the second had 3 shares, and <br>
 the last had 5 shares, showing that people were actively sharing our Livestream. Our average <br>
  concurrent viewers were around 6 to 7, with a peak of about 17 to 19 viewers, which is <br>
   a very strong viewership rate for our streams. We kept our audience hooked by answering <br>
    their questions, giving shoutouts, and interacting through speech and the chat box.
<br>
<br>
Our viewership performance has been outstanding, and if we continue to engage with our audience <br>
and possibly expand our content by playing more games such as Valorant, Marvel Rivals, CS:GO 2, <br>
 League of Legends, Minecraft and etc, we can attract even more viewers and continue<br>
 building on this success.
