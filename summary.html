        <h3>SUMMARY OF STREAM</h3>

        <br>

        <p>This summary outlines the events and happenings during the live stream of our stream page, the <br> Late Gamerz Stream. The live stream, held on February 8, 2025, from 1:00 to 4:00 PM, mainly <br> focused on a gaming stream that played only one game: Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. 
<br>
<br>
We played ranked matches at the start of our live and we were a complete 5-man team. We played the <br>
first match using our main heroes. We also came up with a way to make playing ranked matches more <br>
enjoyable by asking a viewer about some ways we can accomplish this. A viewerâ€™s suggestion says <br>
that we can challenge ourselves by using the spin the wheel and by that, we generate the idea <br>
 that  the wheel will contain team roles and we will assign each person to each spin and whatever <br>
 it hits will be their role for the next matches. 
<br>
<br>
At the last agenda of our stream, we invited the other group, the CtrlAltWin, to have a one-match<br>
 scrimmage with us since the other group will also play MLBB on their live stream. We played a <br>
  5v5 match in a draft pick mode so we can have bannings. At the end of the game, we had a good fight<br>
   with the other group and won the scrimmage. In that way, the live stream was properly transitioned <br>
    to our last part of the stream which is having a short goodbye and thank you message to the viewers <br>
     who watched and supported us until the end.
