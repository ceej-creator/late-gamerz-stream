        <h3>LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT</h3>

        

        <p>The primary objective of our live stream was to provide entertainment through gaming, <br>
             and our chosen game for our first live stream was Mobile Legends. The effectiveness  <br>
             of our choice of game and platform for the stream was reflected in our viewership. <br>
              Garnering more than 290 views for the first stream shows that this had a positive  <br>
              effect on our viewership and attracted our target audience.  <br>
<br>

Being conscious of our target audience also affected engagement, making it easier to know how to  <br>
 interact with our viewers, and in turn, our live stream achieved a medium level of engagement through  <br>
  friendly and humorous interactions with viewers. The key strategy involved direct interaction with  <br>
  the participants by responding to their chats, giving shout-outs, answering questions, and  <br>
  implementing viewer-suggested challenges into the gameplay, fostering a sense of collaboration  <br>
  and investment.  <br>
<br>

Chat activity and viewership numbers were the main indicators of engagement, with noteworthy <br>
interactions contributing to the stream's lighthearted atmosphere. While not reaching peak engagement<br>
 levels, participants expressed enjoyment of the experience through the chat box while streaming,<br>
  and our feedback survey after the live took place, indicating a successful, albeit moderately<br>
   engaging live stream.<br>
